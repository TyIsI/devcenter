= Getting Started with JBoss EAP 6 on OpenShift
[.lead]
It's easy to get up and running with JBoss EAP (EAP) on OpenShift and the experience will be very similar to the experience of running it on any Linux system.

OpenShift supports both source and WAR file deploys and modification of `standalone.xml`. One important caveat - applications will not have write permissions to the `{EAP Home}/standalone/deployments` directory, so you will have to write content to another directory. Finally, given the usual memory requirements of Enterprise Java applications, it is recommended to use a Large or Medium gear size.

== Step 1: Create a JBoss EAP (EAP) Application
This tutorial walks through the creation of an application titled *myeapapp* under the domain *mydomain*.

NOTE: Before going through the rest of the tutorial, make sure to have link:https://www.openshift.com/app/account[created an OpenShift account] and link:/managing-your-applications/client-tools.html[installed the RHC command line tools].

Once that is completed, open a terminal on a local machine and change into a directory where the source code will be located.  At the command prompt enter the following command to create a EAP application:

[source, console]
----
$ rhc app-create myeapapp jbosseap
----

The output will look something like this:

[source, console]
----
Using jbosseap-6 (JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6) for 'jbosseap'

Application Options

[[step2]]
== Step 2: Make the First Change
You can make code changes on a local machine, check those changes in locally, and then `push` those changes to OpenShift. One of the primary advantages of Git is that it does not require a continuous online presence in order to run. You can easily check in (in Git terminology, `commit`) and revert changes locally before deciding to upload those changes to OpenShift.

=== Using the Git Repository
To make the first change, edit `index.html` in the `myeapapp/src/main/webapp` directory of the local Git repository. Go to the file in the terminal and edit with a command line editor like *VIM* or *EMacs*. Alternatively, edit the file using any text editor or IDE. Strip out everything between the two `<body>` tags and change the content to look like this:

[source, html]
----
<body>
	<h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>
----

Now that you have made this code change, the code must be deployed to the server. Accomplish this task using *Git*.


. To add the change to the Git repository's index and stage it for the next commit, use the command `git add`:
+
[source, console]
----
$ git add --all .
----
+
. Next `commit` the staged changes to the Git repository, with a log message to explain the changes:
+
[source, console]
----
$ git commit -m "Your commit message"
----
+
. Finally, `push` these changes to the remote OpenShift application.
+
[source, console]
----
$ git push
----

The output of the push command will first show the git push and then the build process and deployment for the OpenShift application. When the build is finished, go back to the application's URL (_myeapapp-mydomain.rhcloud.com_) and see a page which just says "Hello World" in nice big font.

This is the basic process to follow when developing an application: `git add`, `git commit`, and finally `git push`.

If you are curious about Git or would like to learn more, the link:http://git-scm.com/book[Pro Git book] is a great resource.

== Step 3: Deploying WAR files
OpenShift also supports *WAR* files deployment. There are several processes which are each very simple. Please visit the link:/servers/jbosseap/deployment-options.html[deployment options page] for more information.

== Other Tips

=== `standalone.xml` and Modules
Most of the behavior of EAP can be controlled through the link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.3/html/Administration_and_Configuration_Guide/sect-Configuration_Files.html[standalone.xml] file. In OpenShift you can find `standalone.xml` inside your application's Git repository.

`standalone.xml` can be found in the `{git repo}/.openshift/config/` directory. Please be careful when making a change to the file. Also, make sure the EAP server restarts after making the change. You will also find a directory titled `modules` in the same directory. If you are using link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/JBoss_Enterprise_Application_Platform/6.3/html/Development_Guide/sect-About_Modules_and_the_New_Modular_Class_Loading_System_used_in_JBoss_EAP_6.html[Jboss Modules] to load classes outside of the server or application provided classes - for example custom drivers for a JDBC/JNDI connection - you would place them in this location.

=== Hot Deploy and Other Markers
With a normal `git push` as outlined above, Openshift starts and stops the EAP server on each build. For Java applications, a WAR/EAR file can be built and deployed without restarting the server. See link:/managing-your-applications/modifying-applications.html#hot-deployment[Hot Deployment] for more information on how OpenShift uses a marker in the git repository to turn on this build style.

==== Other Markers
In addition to the `hot_deploy` marker, the other markers probably of most use are `enable_jpda`, which turns on the jpda transport for debugging and `force_clean_build` which forces Maven to re-download all the dependencies for the application. The markers for EAP can be found link:/servers/jbosseap/markers.html[here].

=== Adding a Database to an Appliction
Find out how to add a database to your application by going to the link:/managing-your-applications/adding-a-database.html[Adding a Database] guide.

IMPORTANT: You should only use link:/managing-your-applications/environment-variables.html[environment variables] to specify the connection parameters for your database. Using hard coded names, ports, or credentials limits the resusability of your app and can potentially break your app during OpenShift maintenance.

By default MySQL and Postgresql have JNDI entries in your `standalone.xml`. As noted above, you can edit your `standalone.xml`, which allows you to delete or add other JNDI sources to your application. The syntax is standard syntax, there are no modifications needed for OpenShift, other than using the proper Environment Variables for the DB.

=== Configuring JVM properties
link:/managing-your-applications/environment-variables.html[Environment variables] can also be used to configure JVM properties. By setting the `JAVA_OPTS_EXT` environment variable, extra `JAVA_OPTS` can be added before the JVM is invoked. Here is an example setting the setting other garbage collection properties.

[source]
----
$ rhc env-set JAVA_OPTS_EXT="-XX:+PrintGCDetails  -Xloggc:$OPENSHIFT_LOG_DIR/gc.log" --app mytomcatapp
----

[WARNING]
====
Please note that the startup parameters already set for EAP cannot be overwritten or changed. The parameters can be viewed via SSH'ing into your application gear using the following command:

[source]
----
$ ps axwwww | grep java
----
====

=== Clustering
By default, the JBoss EAP cartridge is configured to cluster when used in a scalable application. When the second and subsequent gears are spun up with EAP, they will automatically talk across the EAP clustering ports and form a cluster. This provides for a higher availability application instance as the cluster will share sessions. There is a link:http://www.redhat.com/en/resources/jboss-eap-6-clustering[reference architecture] that covers the benefits of an EAP cluster.
