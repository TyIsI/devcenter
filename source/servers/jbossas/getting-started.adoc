= Getting Started with JBoss AS 7 on OpenShift
[.lead]
It's easy to get up and running with JBoss AS on OpenShift and the experience will be very similar to the experience of running it on any Linux system.

OpenShift supports both source and WAR file deploys and modification of `standalone.xml`. One important caveat - applications will not have write permissions to the `{AS Home}/standalone/deployments` directory, so you will have to write content to another directory. Finally, given the usual memory requirements of Java applications, it is recommended to use a Large or Medium gear size.

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Create a JBoss AS) Application
This tutorial walks through the creation of an application titled *myjbossasapp* under the domain *mydomain*.

NOTE: Before going through the rest of the tutorial, make sure to have link:https://www.openshift.com/app/account[created an OpenShift account] and link:/managing-your-applications/client-tools.html[installed the RHC command line tools].

Once that is completed, open a terminal on a local machine and change into a directory where the source code will be located.  At the command prompt enter the following command to create a JBoss AS application:

[source, console]
----
$ rhc app-create myasapp jbossas
----

The output will look something like this:

[source, console]
----
$ rhc app create myjbossasapp jbossas
Using jbossas-7 (JBoss Application Server 7) for 'jbossas'

Application Options
-------------------
Domain:     osexample
Cartridges: jbossas-7
Gear Size:  default
Scaling:    no

Creating application 'myjbossasapp' ... done


Waiting for your DNS name to be available ... done

Cloning into 'myjbossasapp'...

Your application 'myjbossasapp' is now available.

  URL:        http://myjbossasapp-osexample.rhcloud.com/ <1>
  SSH to:     54f4a852e0b8cd030000001e@myjbossasapp-osexample.rhcloud.com
  Git remote: ssh://54f4a852e0b8cd030000001e@myjbossasapp-osexample.rhcloud.com/~/git/myjbossasapp.git/
  Cloned to:  /Users/<user>/Desktop/myjbossasapp <2>

Run 'rhc show-app myjbossasapp' for more details about your app.

----
<1> Public URL of application
<2> Location of local Git repository

The application is now running and accessible at the *URL (1)* listed in the output. A local git repository for your application was also created in the directory listed under *Cloned to (2)*.

[[step2]]
== Step 2: Make the First Change
You can make code changes on a local machine, check those changes in locally, and then `push` those changes to OpenShift. One of the primary advantages of Git is that it does not require a continuous online presence in order to run. You can easily check in (in Git terminology, `commit`) and revert changes locally before deciding to upload those changes to OpenShift.

=== Using the Git Repository
To make the first change, edit `index.html` in the `myjbossasapp/src/main/webapp` directory of the local Git repository. Go to the file in the terminal and edit with a command line editor like *VIM* or *EMacs*. Alternatively, edit the file using any text editor or IDE. Strip out everything between the two `<body>` tags and change the content to look like this:

[source, html]
----
<body>
	<h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>
----

Now that you have made this code change, the code must be deployed to the server. Accomplish this task using *Git*.


. To add the change to the Git repository's index and stage it for the next commit, use the command `git add`:
+
[source, console]
----
$ git add --all .
----
+
. Next `commit` the staged changes to the Git repository, with a log message to explain the changes:
+
[source, console]
----
$ git commit -m "Your commit message"
----
+
. Finally, `push` these changes to the remote OpenShift application.
+
[source, console]
----
$ git push
----

The output of the push command will first show the git push and then the build process and deployment for the OpenShift application. When the build is finished, go back to the application's URL (_myjbossasapp-mydomain.rhcloud.com_) and see a page which just says "Hello World" in nice big font.

This is the basic process to follow when developing an application: `git add`, `git commit`, and finally `git push`.

[[step3]]
== Step 3: Deploying WAR files
OpenShift also supports the deployment of *WAR* files. There are several processes which are each very simple. Please visit the  link:/servers/jbossas/deployment-options.html[deployment options page] to learn more about deploying WAR files on OpenShift Online.

== Other Tips

=== `standalone.xml` and Modules
Most of the behavior of JBoss AS can be controlled through the standalone.xml file. In OpenShift you can find `standalone.xml` inside your application's Git repository.

`standalone.xml` can be found in the `{git repo}/.openshift/config/` directory. Please be careful when making a change to the file. Also, make sure the EAP server restarts after making the change. You will also find a directory titled `modules` in the same directory. If you are using Jboss Modules to load classes outside of the server or application provided classes - for example custom drivers for a JDBC/JNDI connection - you would place them in this location.

To learn more about the `standalone.xml` file and the `Modules` directory, please refere to the link:https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS7/Getting+Started+Guide[Official Documentation].

=== Hot Deploy and Other Markers
With a normal `git push` as outlined above, Openshift starts and stops the EAP server on each build. For Java applications, a WAR/EAR file can be built and deployed without restarting the server. See link:/managing-your-applications/modifying-applications.html#hot-deployment[Hot Deployment] for more information on how OpenShift uses a marker in the git repository to turn on this build style.

==== Other Markers
In addition to the `hot_deploy` marker, the other markers probably of most use are `enable_jpda`, which turns on the jpda transport for debugging and `force_clean_build` which forces Maven to re-download all the dependencies for the application. The markers for JBoss AS can be found link:/servers/jbossas/markers.html[here].

=== Adding a Database to an Appliction
Find out how to add a database to your application by going to the link:/managing-your-applications/adding-a-database.html[Adding a Database] guide.

IMPORTANT: You should only use link:/managing-your-applications/environment-variables.html[environment variables] to specify the connection parameters for your database. Using hard coded names, ports, or credentials limits the resusability of your app and can potentially break your app during OpenShift maintenance.

By default MySQL and Postgresql have JNDI entries in your `standalone.xml`. As noted above, you can edit your `standalone.xml`, which allows you to delete or add other JNDI sources to your application. The syntax is standard syntax, there are no modifications needed for OpenShift, other than using the proper Environment Variables for the DB.

=== Configuring JVM properties
link:/managing-your-applications/environment-variables.html[Environment variables] can also be used to configure JVM properties. By setting the `JAVA_OPTS_EXT` environment variable, extra `JAVA_OPTS` can be added before the JVM is invoked. Here is an example setting the setting other garbage collection properties.

[source]
----
$ rhc env-set JAVA_OPTS_EXT="-XX:+PrintGCDetails  -Xloggc:$OPENSHIFT_LOG_DIR/gc.log" --app myjbossasapp
----

[WARNING]
====
Please note that the startup parameters already set for JBoss AS cannot be overwritten or changed. The parameters can be viewed by SSH'ing into your application gear and executing the following command:

[source]
----
$ ps axwwww | grep java
----
