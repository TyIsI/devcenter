= Getting Started with the Flask Microframework

link:http://flask.pocoo.org[Flask] is a popular open-source microframework for Python. This tutorial steps through the process of creating a Python application on OpenShift and adding the Flask microframework.

NOTE: If you prefer not to follow the tutorial below, you can deploy link:https://hub.openshift.com/quickstarts/116-flask[this Flask QuickStart template] instead, producing a slightly different Flask application.

[[step1]]
== Step 1: Create Python Application

Create a Python 2.7 application on OpenShift with the following terminal command. You will need link:https://www.openshift.com/app/account[an OpenShift account] and link:/managing-your-applications/client-tools.html[RHC]. More details about this process are covered in the link:/languages/python/getting-started.html[Getting Started with Python tutorial].

[source, console]
----
$ rhc app create myflaskapp python-2.7
----

link:http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/python3/[Flask can be used with Python 3] and this works on OpenShift, but the framework authors recommend using Python 2.

Once the RHC command has completed, a Git repository will have been cloned to your local machine in a directory called *myflaskapp*.

[[step2]]
== Step 2: Add Flask Dependency

Dependencies can be added to your Python application via link:/languages/python/repository-layout.html[*requirements.txt* or *setup.py*].

Open *myflaskapp/requirements.txt* in an editor and add a line so it looks like the following:

[source, python]
----
Flask==0.10.1
----

Flask will be available to your application on OpenShift when this change is pushed to the platform.

[[step3]]
== Step 3: Create Basic Flask App

Create a new file *flaskapp.py* in the Git repository, and add the following contents of the Flask 'Hello World' app:

[source, python]
----
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
----

[[step4]]
== Step 4: Update Entry Point

The default entry point for the Python application is *wsgi.py*. The next step is to alter this file so that it serves the new Flask application.

Open *wsgi.py* in an editor, and delete the entire method *def application(environ, start_response)* (it is quite long). Replace the method with a line to import your Flask application, as shown below:

[source, python]
----
#
# IMPORTANT: Put any additional includes below this line.  If placed above this
# line, it's possible required libraries won't be in your searchable path
#

from flaskapp import app as application

#
# Below for testing only
#
----

If you want to be able to test your Flask app locally, there are a couple of other changes you should make to *wsgi.py*. Firstly, change the line defining *virtenv* to the following:

[source, python]
----
virtenv = os.path.join(os.environ.get('OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_DIR','.'), 'virtenv')
----

This code caters for cases when the *OPENSHIFT_PYTHON_DIR* link:/managing-your-applications/environment-variables.html[environment variable] is not available, such as on your local machine.

Next, update the line *httpd.handle_request()* to instead serve forever.

[source, python]
----
httpd.serve_forever()
----

With these changes in place and link:http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/installation/[Flask installed on your local machine], you should be able to run your app locally with the following command:

[source, console]
----
$ python wsgi.py
----

The application will be available at link:http://localhost:8051/[http://localhost:8051]. Use Control+C or a similar command to terminate the local server.

[[step5]]
== Step 5: Deploy to OpenShift

Deploy the Flask application to OpenShift using the standard Git process:

[source, console]
----
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "Adding Flask application"
$ git push
----

Once the Git push has completed, you should see the 'Hello World!' message when you navigate to your application at _\http://myflaskapp-<yourdomain>.rhcloud.com_.

== Next Steps

You now have a Flask application running on OpenShift. To learn more about Flask, dive into the link:http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/[documentation].

This link:http://github.com/openshift-quickstart/flask-base[OpenShift Flask QuickStart] gives an example of serving static files and a possible application layout. The QuickStart can be used as a template for link:https://openshift.redhat.com/app/console/application_type/custom?cartridges%5B%5D=python-2.7&initial_git_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fopenshift-quickstart%2Fflask-base.git[quickly and easily creating Flask apps on OpenShift].

To learn how to add a database to your application, see link:/managing-your-applications/adding-a-database.html[the OpenShift database tutorial]. link:http://pythonhosted.org/Flask-SQLAlchemy/[Flask-SQLAlchemy] is a popular Flask extension for working with databases using the link:http://www.sqlalchemy.org/[SQLAlchemy] Object Relational Mapper.
