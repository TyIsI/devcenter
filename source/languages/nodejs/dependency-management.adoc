= Node.js Dependency Management with NPM

[float]
In addition to the usual `git` and the `rhc` command-line tools, you'll need to install Nodejs as a local development dependency.  The `npm` package manager comes bundled with all recent releases of Nodejs.

[[dependencies]]
== Document Your Dependencies
Installing new module dependencies using the `--save` flag will help keep your project's  link:/languages/nodejs/project-structure.html#package.json[`package.json` file] up to date:

[source, console]
----
$ npm install --save cloud-env
----

Any dependencies that are link:https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/package.json.html#dependencies[correctly documented in your project's `package.json` file] can be  link:/languages/nodejs/project-structure.html#node_modules[automatically installed as a part of OpenShift's automated build process].

NOTE: Command line utilities that are usually installed using the `-g` or `--global` flag will be automatically be added to the system `$PATH`, as long as they are included in the `dependencies` or `devDependencies` sections of the project's `package.json` file.

[[run]]
== Local Development
Most  link:/languages/nodejs/project-structure.html[Nodejs projects] can be initialized by runing `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

`npm install` will attempt to resolve any npm module dependencies that have been declaired in the project's `package.json` file, installing them into the `node_modules` folder.

[source, console]
----
$ npm install
----

If the project's  link:/languages/nodejs/project-structure.html#package.json[`package.json`] file has been //languages/nodejs/project-structure.html#package.json[configured correctly], running `npm start` should allow you to start a local webserver:

[source, console]
----
$ npm start
