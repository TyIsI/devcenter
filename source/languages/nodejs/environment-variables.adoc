= Node.js Environment Variables

[float]
OpenShift's Nodejs cartridge uses the following system environment variables to publish router connection details, and to customize the application's build, hosting, and scaling routines:

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Environment Variable | Use

|OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP
|Bind to this IP address in order to recieve traffic from the routing layer
|OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT
|Listen on this port to recieve traffic from the routing layer
|OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_POLL_INTERVAL
|This integer value may be set as an environment variable (default is 1 second)
|NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION
|OpenShift will not install `devDependencies` link:http://stackoverflow.com/a/23749201/754025[when `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` is set to "true"]
|===

See the master index of link:/managing-your-applications/environment-variables.html[Environment Variables] for more information.

Developers can safely store API keys and other credentials in the system environment by using `rhc env set`, allowing for clean and portable application sources.

[[listen]]
== Listen Up!
You'll need to  link:/languages/nodejs/project-structure.html#server.js[include a small check to test for the presence of OpenShift-provided environment variables] in your server's `listen()` call:

[source,javascript]
----
var server_port = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_PORT || 8080
var server_ip_address = process.env.OPENSHIFT_NODEJS_IP || '127.0.0.1'

server.listen(server_port, server_ip_address, function(){
  console.log("Listening on " + server_ip_address + ", server_port " + server_port)
});
----

The above code provides sensible defaults that will allow the application to run in local development environments, while taking advantage of OpenShift-provided configuration details when they are available.

See link:https://www.npmjs.org/package/cloud-env[`cloud-env`] and link:https://www.npmjs.org/package/config-multipaas[`config-multipaas`] for tools that can help manage your application's autoconfiguration in cloud hosting environments.
